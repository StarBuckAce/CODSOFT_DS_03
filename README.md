# Fraudulent Credit Card Transaction Detection Using Machine Learning
**Project Overview**
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that identifies fraudulent credit card transactions. The model will preprocess and normalize transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and classify transactions as either fraudulent or genuine. Various classification algorithms, such as logistic regression and random forests, will be utilized to achieve this.
